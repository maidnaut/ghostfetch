# Ghostfetch

<img src="fetch.png">

Converted from Tengu's [custom fetcher](https://github.com/Tengu42x/fetcher). I think i set this repo up right, sorry if I forked it wrong c:

Install Fyglet for ascii text and Nerd Fonts for icons. Place the files in ~/.config/fastfetch/

Customization is really simple, just provide arguments to the logo source. Give it the string name of an ansi color (see source.sh for what's included) and the text you want fyglet to print. Shrimple as.

-c='color'
-t='text'
